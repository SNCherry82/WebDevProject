                I was always told growing up that an LDS mission will change your life. Mine certainly did, foods like peaches or oreos that I hated I had a newfound appreciation for. I finally managed to make consistent exercise a habit. But one change I didn't really expect was that I'd become a comic reader. I've always liked superheroes and all the movies and tv shows associated with all of them, but when I got home from Peru, I suddenly liked reading the comic books they came from. Just to clarify, I wasn't buying comic books, but rather I found "audio comics" on youtube and would have a more interactive experience reading through some of the best comic runs in history. Something I came to find since I've been home though, is that which heroes belong to which comic companies still isn't common knowledge, even with all the mainstream popularity they have in Hollywood these days. So I figured I'd take a minute to break down the big comic book companies and their respective properties to try and make it more widely known.

                As you can see above, the two big dogs in the comic industry are Marvel and DC, I think the companies are well known, it's their properties that get confused. After Marvel and DC, I want to talk briefly about the properties of the next 3 largest companies: Image, Dark Horse, and IDW Publishing (Boom Studios had a big year, but aren't actually in the top 5).

        <p class="margleft">
            As you can see from the chart above, Marvel has been more succesful in Hollywood, and I would have to agree, their movies have been better, and before my mission while my only comic exposure was through blockbuster movies, I was a Marvel fan. But when I started getting into the actual comics, I quickly switched sides to DC, between the big two, I feel like DC makes better comics, and they also have made some faithful animated adaptations of their comics and beat Marvel in the animated side of movies, although many are direct to TV releases instead of theatrical releases. That being said, some of my favorite comics, such as TMNT's "The Last Ronin" or "Invincible" are properties not owned by Marvel or DC, so while you can have your side in the battle of the big two, I suggest reading anything that seems interesting to you, because there's so much out there in the world of comic books.
